# Vikingos Analyzer Project Plan
## Scope
### Main features
\- Code Entry: Users will be able to enter blocks of code in a specific format.

\- Lexical Analysis: The system will identify and classify lexical tokens in the code.

\- Syntactic Analysis: It will check if the code structure complies with the defined grammar.

\- Error Handling: Clear error messages will be provided in case lexical or syntactic errors are found.

### Objectives

\- Develop a lexical and syntactic analyzer capable of processing and validating user-supplied source code.

\- Classify lexical and syntactic errors in the code and provide descriptive error messages.

\- Provide a friendly user interface for users to enter and verify their code.

\- Ensure efficiency and accuracy in lexical and syntactic analysis
